### UIC, Chicago, United States
## Experience 1
### Supervised by Prof. Anrin Chakraborti
* Department of Computer Science
* August 2025 - Present


# Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
### Technion, Shantou, China
## Experience 2
### Supervised by Prof. Guillermo Benito Morales Luna
* Department of Mathematics with Computer Science
* October 2023 - January 2025
* Duties & Achievements:
  * Designed and developed a system realizing the programming reduction of an NP-Complete problem by researching relevant papers and using C/C++, i.e., calculating the polynomial-time reductions of the k-GraphColoring problem.
  * Implemented a public-key encryption scheme based on Chebyshev Polynomials; utilized GNU Multiple Precision Library to increase the arithmetic precision; developed the complexity from O(n) to O(logn) by adopting matrix representation of Chebyshev polynomials and binary expression factorization of extremely large numbers to boost computational efficiency.
  * Conducted numerical analysis of the cryptosystem to identify the correlation between the success of the decryption and the number of significant digits of plaintexts, *l*, and the precision of the arithmetical calculations, *m*.
  * Performed the Bergamo's attack to the numerical implementation of the cryptosystem; assessed the system's robustness by pointing out the relevance of the effectiveness of the attack and *l*, *m*.
  * Spent hundreds of hours conducting extensive and in-depth research, growing into a more independent, self-motivated, and passionate learner.

## Experience 3
### Supervised by Prof. Khadga Jung Karki
* Department of Physics, Functional Nonlinear Spectroscopy Lab
* December 2021 - December 2024
* Duties & Achievements:
  * Developed the Analog Digital Converter of a signal acquisition equipment, RedPitaya,to realize continuous signal acquisition with C/C++; stored experimental data using binary numbers instead of ASCII to reduce the memory occupation.
  * Developed software programs of a stepping machine and RedPitaya to achieve simultaneous operation, thus simplifying the experiments and increasing the efficiency; created a Graphical User Interface using wxWidgets to provide easy accessibility for other lab members.
  * Followed the Frequency Resolved Optical Gating method to retrieve the phase from experimental data of unknown pulses based on the Principal Component Generalized Projection algorithm using Matlab/Python; refined the iteration of the algorithms by comparing and adopting various methods from literature to enhance the accuracy of the phase retrieval process.
  * Supported fellow graduate students majoring in Physics in the lab in writing scripts, developing programs, and understanding the algorithms; collaborated closely with them in analyzing optical properties of processed data after applying the algorithms and Fourier transform, such as intensity, phase, and frequency modulation.

## Experience 4
### Supervised by Dr. Thanana Nuchkrua
* Department of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics
* March 2021 - December 2021
* Duties:
  * Prepared the business plan, posters, and videos of the project "Smart System of AI", and exhibited the work at the 2021 China Innovation and Entrepreneurship Fair in Guangzhou. [link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/qPAsyiukv9PwSQHD7rgrsQ)
  * Managed the annotation of Dr. Thananaâ€™s teaching material, and provided clear and comprehensive explanations of challenging concepts for fellow group members; engaged in preparing and applying for project approval and funding from the Chinese government.
