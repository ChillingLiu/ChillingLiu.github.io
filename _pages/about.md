Hello! My name is Xiaoqi, the meaning of it is "a little curious". If you know Xiaomi, then the pronunciation of my name would be quite simple, just sounds like "Xiao~ + chi". I also have an Enlish name called Chilling, I just took it because it sounds similar to my Chinese name, so feel free to call me in this way.

I'm current a last year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science from [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), China Campus, aka [GTIIT](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn/en/). My research interest includes theoretical computer science, security and numerical analysis.

**I'm actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD starting from Fall 2025.**
