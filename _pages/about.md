Hello! My name is Xiaoqi, which means "a little curious" in Chinese. If you know Xiaomi, then the pronunciation of my name would be quite simple: just sounds like "Xiao~ + chi." I also have an English name, Chilling, which I chose for the similarity to my Chinese name. Feel free to call me either name.

I'm currently a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [UIC](https://www.uic.edu/) under the supervison of Prof. [Anrin Chakraborti](https://anrinch.github.io/). Prior to join UIC, I received my Bechelor's degree in Mathematics with Computer Science from [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), China Campus ([GTIIT](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn/en/)), where I was supervised by Prof. [Guillermo Morales-Luna](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YXDir_kAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Khadga J. Karki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=txPZAq0AAAAJ&hl=en). Throughout my research journey, I found immense satisfaction in the procedures of problem-solving and knowledge-exploring, and I'm passionate to make significant contribution in the field of computer science. You can find more about my motivation in the [Statement of Purpose](/files/StatementOfPurpose.pdf).

As a student, I admire the elegance of Mathematics very much, which is why my research interest focuses on the application of Mathematical concepts, such as applied cryptography and cybersecurity.

To know more about me, I invite you to explore this website. Thank you for your interest!
