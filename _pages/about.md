Hello! My name is Xiaoqi, which means "a little curious" in Chinese. If you know Xiaomi, then the pronunciation of my name would be quite simple: just sounds like "Xiao~ + chi." I also have an English name, Chilling, which I chose for the similarity to my Chinese name. Feel free to call me either name.

I'm currently a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science from [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), China Campus ([GTIIT](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn/en/)). I'm very fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Morales-Luna in Computer Science research, and Prof. Karki in Data Analysis research. Throughout my research journey, I found immense satisfaction in the procedures of problem-solving and knowledge-exploring, and I'm passionate to make significant contribution in the field of computer science. You can find more about my motivation in the [Statement of Purpose](/files/StatementOfPurpose.pdf).

As a student, I admire the elegance of Mathematics very much, which is why my research interest focuses on the application of Mathematical concepts, such as theoretical computer science, applied cryptography and cybersecurity.

I'm honored to be admitted to the PhD program in Computer Science at University of Illinois Chicago [UIC](https://www.uic.edu/) from 2025 Fall. I'm excited to work with my advisor Prof. Anrin Chakraborti in the upcoming 5 years focusing on cybersecurity!

My advantages include:
* Solid foundation in Mathematics
* Extensive research experience
* Strong collaborative and communication skills
* Effective teaching experience
