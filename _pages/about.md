Hello! My name is Xiaoqi, the meaning of it is "a little curious". If you know Xiaomi, then the pronunciation of my name would be quite simple, just sounds like "Xiao~ + chi". I also have an Enlish name called Chilling, I just took it because it sounds similar to my Chinese name, so feel free to call me in this way.

I'm current a last year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics with Computer Science from [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/), China Campus, aka [GTIIT](https://www.gtiit.edu.cn/en/). I'm very fortunate and glad to do the Computer Science research under Prof. Morales-Luna's supervision and Data Analysis research under Prof. Karki's supervision. 

my research interest includes theoretical computer science, security and numerical analysis.

**I'm actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD starting from Fall 2025.**
